      <h2>The Importance of Usability Test</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="p1">Hi！ This is the fourth assignment of COMM5961.<br><br>
        Since my problem statement is “How might we make an enthusiastic K-pop fan with full-time jobs who wants to buy different kinds of Kpop albums online easily comparing different prices, collecting scattered and incomplete information about pre-sale gifts, and logistics tracking from different album e-shops, so that she/he can save time by easily finding albums, e-shops from which she/he wants to purchase, and tracking logistics?”，so this product is a collection of album information and a fan-sharing platform for K-pop fans in China, allowing users to check and compare album information and make purchases conveniently.
      <br><br>Here is the information architecture of my product: </p>
      <br>
        <img class="img1" src="image_0401.jpeg">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        In order to accomplish this goal, the main features my product needs to provide are:<br>
        1. Provide information about the artists and their released albums<br>
        2. Provide information on album prices, pre-sale gifts, sales platforms and purchase channels<br>
        3. Logistics information storage and query<br>
        4. Entertainment community for publishing comments and recommendations<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When I finished the prototype design, I realized that many of the design problems could not be solved by myself, and needed to be enhanced through trial and feedback from the target customers. So I designed a usability test to collect feedback from target customers on the usability and business value of the product to prepare for enhancements. The main hypotheses include: <br>
        1. Do people understand the value of information aggregation platforms?<br>
        2. Do people find it helpful?<br>
        3. Do people know how to complete a purchase through the site?<br>
        4. Do people know how to post and communicate with others?<br><br>
        Here is my Usability Test Plan Dashboard:<br>
        <img class="img2" src="image_0402.jpeg"><br><br>
        By testing these hypotheses, I will learn if the target customers thinks the product will help them with their problems through out the purchase process, if they are satisfied with the current product, and if they are willing to pay for it. This will be the most important part of my problem solving process.
